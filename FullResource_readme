===================== A. Pre-requisites

For deployment of personal manual patch
Windows: WinRAR v5.0 or later  [https://www.rarlab.com/]
Android: RAR  [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rarlab.rar]


Manual Download of Patch Files

Notes:
If you'd like to just login to the game ASAP, download only "AndroidAllData".
Features like Intelligence Center, Forward Basecamp, etc., will not be able until you download the additional resources.
You can do this while in-game though, or proceed to also download the additional resource "AndroidAddData".

===================== B. Instructions

Our Working folder: Android\data\com.sunborn.girlsfrontline.en\files\Android\New\

1) Extract the Minimal (AndroidAllData) .dat file to working folder.
   Copy `AndroidResConfigData.txt` to it as well.
2) Run GFL, with FullResource download **un**checked.
   It should see the extracted files and reduce the required download size from 986MB down to around 315MB.
3) **Copy** Additional (AndroidAddData) .dat to working folder.
4) Run GFL, this time with FullResource download checked, and let it unpack the copied .dat. Close client after.
5) Run GFL for the last time, for remaining update files. (currently around 155MB)



===================== C. Repair Archive

In case part of the archive is damaged, you may attempt to repair the file.
A damaged archive will usually fail to extract some files properly.
This archive file has a Recovery Volume for such cases.

WINDOWS
1) Open file in WinRAR (or select the file inside RAR).
2) Go to "Tools" > "Repair archive".
3) Change the output path if need be, and choose the "Treat the corrupt archive as RAR" radio button.
4) Press OK button to start repairing.
5) When finished, a new file will be created with the prefix "fixed."; this will be the repaired version of the archive file.
   Results log will also show how much damage was repaired, if any.

ANDROID
1) Open file in RAR (or select the file inside RAR).
2) Tap the vertically-aligned three dots on the top-right corner.
3) Tap "Repair archive".
4) Confirm prompt by tapping "OK".
5) When finished, a new file will be created with the prefix "fixed."; this will be the repaired version of the archive file.
   Results log will also show how much damage was repaired, if any.


Notes:
* Sometimes this works for the .dat files that are ZIP files anyway; This "rebuilds" the archive instead, somehow similar to repair.


===================== D. FAQ/Others

1Q) The size of GFL is increasing! (Exceeding 4GB or so)
1A) Delete the temporary downloaded files (*.dat & *.temp) left in the following game file location:

Android\data\com.sunborn.girlsfrontline.en\files\Android\New\

2Q) Am I in the right "New" folder?
2A) The directory tree of the target working folder should look something like the following:

Internal storage (/storage/emulated/0)
- Android
  - data
    + com.app
    + com.some.app
    + com.some.other.app
    - com.sunborn.girlsfrontline.en
      + cache
      - files
        + activity
        + AIHlepSDK
        - Android
          + New        <-- This is the folder we should be working in
        + cartoon
        + il2cpp
        + stc
        + Unity
        + UnityCache
    + com.yet.another.app
  + obb

3Q) I play GFL in an iOS device. Is there a workaround for when I encounter the "Insufficient Memory" error or when the app size bloat up more than 4GB?
3A) Unfortunatley there is no known workaround for iOS devices. You will have to repeatedly Clear Cache in-game after several attempts of patching.

This Girls' Frontline [EN] Manual Patch was made for personal use, and it worked for me like a charm.
It is then provided to the community as-is in case it helps anyone else.
Due to differences in configurations and the like, your mileage may vary.
No warranty provided; Use at your own risk.
Though do let me know, as we might be able to fix or work around what makes it not work.
Worst case possible, you'd still have to Clear Cache/Uninstall anyway.

This is not an official product from, nor is officially endorsed by, Sunborn / MICA Team.
