===================== B. Instructions

1) Open archive in WinRAR.
2) Extract & Replace files to the following common path: (may vary slightly before \data\)

Android\data\com.sunborn.girlsfrontline.en\files\Android\New\


===================== C. Repair Archive

In case part of the archive is damaged, you may attempt to repair the file.
A damaged archive will usually fail to extract some files properly.
This archive file has a Recovery Volume for such cases.

WINDOWS
1) Open file in WinRAR (or select the file inside RAR).
2) Go to "Tools" > "Repair archive".
3) Change the output path if need be, and choose the "Treat the corrupt archive as RAR" radio button.
4) Press OK button to start repairing.
5) When finished, a new file will be created with the prefix "fixed."; this will be the repaired version of the archive file.
   Results log will also show how much damage was repaired, if any.

ANDROID
1) Open file in RAR (or select the file inside RAR).
2) Tap the vertically-aligned three dots on the top-right corner.
3) Tap "Repair archive".
4) Confirm prompt by tapping "OK".
5) When finished, a new file will be created with the prefix "fixed."; this will be the repaired version of the archive file.
   Results log will also show how much damage was repaired, if any.


Notes:
* Sometimes this works for the .dat files that are ZIP files anyway; This "rebuilds" the archive instead, somehow similar to repair.

===================== G. Disclaimer

This Girls' Frontline [EN] Manual Patch was made for personal use, and it worked for me like a charm.
It is then provided to the community as-is in case it helps anyone else.
Due to differences in configurations and the like, your mileage may vary.
No warranty provided; Use at your own risk.
Though do let me know, as we might be able to fix or work around what makes it not work.
Worst case possible, you'd still have to Clear Cache/Uninstall anyway.

This is not an official product from, nor is officially endorsed by, Sunborn / MICA Team.
